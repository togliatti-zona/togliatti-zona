## Markdown file for my repository.

As of 8/30/25, I have a few points of confusion. The files that I have tried to commit/push to GitHub have not
worked for whatever reason. I'm using VSCode, and it seems to have a connection to GitHub. The problems that
I'm facing now is that the commits don't want to fully execute.
