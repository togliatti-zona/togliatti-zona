## Markdown for information on Git and GitHub

So far, learning how to edit, commit, push, pull, etc. has been a little off and on. Having used Windows
for pretty much most of my life makes this a world of difference in computing. I'm slowly making progress
in all of these steps to get up and running!

Navigating GitHub is also completely new to me, but I'm making progress there, too. One of these days,
this is all going to make sense and I'll be able to contribute to other things. Now, it's baby steps.
