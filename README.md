## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon, and I'm studying Applied Computing at the University of Arizona with an emphasis on software development.
GitHub is entirely new to me, and it's a little difficult to get things going the way that they need to work.
Progress is slow, but I'm working on getting up and running to learn for CYBV473!
